# Teensy Soundboard
## Teensy 4 based 8 button sample player with speaker output.

### Why?
As a weekend project with the goal to build a birthday present for someone that wants to be disturbing corporate meetings with classic soundbytes eg. slide whistle, airhorn, drumroll etc.

### How?
By wiring 8 [arcade style buttons with builtin LED's](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3429) to a teensy 4 equipped with an [audio hat](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3_audio.html).
Storing files named 1 - 8.wav in 16 bit/41Khz format to an SD card formatted as FAT. The filenames correspond to the buttons so 1.wav is triggered by button 1, 2.wav by the second button so on and so forth.

### Notes
This is my first public repo, you can create an issue but chance is big I will not be adressing it.
